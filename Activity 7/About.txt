In this activity, I wrote a program in RISC-V assembly language that performs the encoding 
and decoding of a Hamming(7,4) code.

INPUT: Line 1 - a sequence of 4 bits to be encoded in a Hamming code using 3 parity bits.
       Line 2 - a sequence of 7 bits that is Hamming encoded, and must be decoded and checked.

OUTPUT: Line 1 - sequence of 7 bits that has been encoded using Hamming code
        Line 2 - sequence of 4 bits that has been decoded from the Hamming code.
        Line 3 - 1 if an error was detected when decoding the Hamming code, 0 otherwise.
