In this activity, I wrote a program in RISC-V assembly language that receives a number via STDIN, goes
through a linked list and prints the index of the node where the sum of the two stored values is equal to the number 
read from STDIN. In case none of the nodes in the linked list fill this requirement, the number -1 must be printed. 

INPUT: An ASCII encoded decimal number on the interval -10000 and 10000.

OUTPUT: Index of the node where the sum of the two stored values is equal to the received value, if it exists 
on the linked list, -1 if it does not exist.
