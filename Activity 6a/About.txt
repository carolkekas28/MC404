For this activity, I wrote a program in RISC-V assembly language that computes the 
approximated square root of integers.

INPUT: Four 4-digit decimal numbers separated by spaces (' '), followed by a newline 
character ('\n'). The whole input takes up 20 bytes.

OUTPUT: For each 4-digit number read, I computed its approximate square root and 
wrote its value to STDOUT using 4-digits and each square root was separated by a 
space (' '). The last one is followed by a newline character ('\n'), so the output 
will also took up 20 bytes.
